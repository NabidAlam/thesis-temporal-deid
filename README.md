# MaskAnyone-Temporal: Thesis Toolkit for Privacy-Preserving Video De-identification

This repository contains the official codebase for my Master's thesis at the University of Potsdam. The project builds on the [MaskAnyone](https://github.com/MaskAnyone/MaskAnyone) framework and integrates temporal segmentation techniques via [TSP-SAM](https://github.com/WenjunHui1/TSP-SAM) and [SAMURAI](https://github.com/yangchris11/samurai).
